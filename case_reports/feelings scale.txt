INTRODUCTION 
You are being asked to volunteer to participate in a VA-approved research study at the VA New York Harbor 
Healthcare System (VA NYHHS). It is important that you read and understand the information on this form and 
discuss it with family and friends if you wish. Ask one of the study staff if there is anything that is not clear or if 
you would like more details. Take your time to decide. 
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE 
Why is this research being done? 
The goal of this research is to adapt and test Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Focused Psychodynamic 
Psychotherapy — eXtended Range (PFPP-XR) a well-established psychotherapy for panic in civilians, for 
Veterans with PTSD and panic. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Focused Psychodynamic Psychotherapy has 
been shown to reduce panic symptoms and improve relationships in people with Panic Disorder. The VA offers 
other treatments for PTSD, but they require Veterans to recall and describe disturbing aspects of their trauma 
and complete homework outside of session. A substantial proportion of veterans do not improve, drop out, or 
are deemed unsuitable for these treatments. As such, many veterans with PTSD need alternatives to address 
the symptoms they experience. Panic symptoms can be debilitating and are experienced by a third of veterans 
with PTSD. PFPP-XR holds promise in its ability to potentially reduce these symptoms. This pilot study will 
examine the feasibility and guide the design of a larger scale study of PFPP-XR for Veterans with PTSD called 
Trauma-Focused Psychodynamic Psychotherapy (TFPP) here at the VA. Some participants in this study will 
receive usual care offered by the VA Mental Health Clinic. 
Why are you being asked to take part? 
You have been identified as an individual who is currently receiving services from the VA, and also may have a 
diagnosis of moderate PTSD symptoms. 
How many people are taking part in the study? 
Approximately 75 Veterans will be offered the opportunity to participate in this study. 
Who is conducting the study and who is sponsoring it? 
Dr. Cory Chen is the Principal Investigator and will be conducting the study with the assistance Collaborator 
Dr. Barbara Milrod, Cornell University. The study is funded by the Clinical and Translational Science Center at

Weill Cornell Medicine. The VA Psychotherapy Research and Development department will retain ownership of 
this project. 
DURATION OF THE RESEARCH 
The expected duration of this study is 1 year. However, your direct involvement will last for approximately 3 
months, with an additional 3-month follow-up visit. 
STUDY PROCEDURES 
If you decide to take part in this study, this is what will happen: 
1) Intake Assessment: This meeting will last approximately 4 hours and will be completed in person with a 
member of our study staff. This assessment will consist of a series of questionnaires and interviews. 
The goal of these assessments is to better understand your symptoms of PTSD. This meeting will 
determine if you are eligible to take part in the remainder of the study. If you have not done so already, 
you will be asked to register for benefits at the VA. 
2) Baseline Assessment: If you are found to be eligible for the study at the Screening Assessment, 
additional questionnaires will be administered to you in person by study staff. These questionnaires will 
help us get a better understanding of your overall level of functioning. This visit will last about 2 hours. 
Not all participants will be entered into TFPP treatment. Upon completion of the Baseline Assessment, you will be 
randomly assigned to either the TFPP group or the CONTROL group Using a procedure like flipping a coin or 
drawing chances from a hat, you will have a 1—in-5 chance of receiving usual care offered by the VA Mental Health 
Clinic, in order to test the structure of the study for future research 
For those enrolled in the TFPP group, this is what will happen: 
1. Active Treatment: TFPP is a 16-24 session treatment conducted over a 16-24-week period. PFPP 
consists of roughly three phases that do not have set numbers of sessions to maximize flexibility. The 
first phase involves exploring the patient's trauma and associated symptoms, the significance of the 
symptoms to the patient, past traumas, and the patient's feelings/experience of the trauma (e.g. guilt, 
mistrust, and anger). The second phase includes helping the patient to understand the trauma as well 
as examining and discussing parallels in the patient's experience in their relationship with the therapist 
with the goal that shifting the patient's experience with the therapist around issues of guilt, trust, anger, 
etc. will generalize to other relationships in the patient's life. Finally, the third phase of the treatment 
involves helping the patient to reflect on and discuss the end of treatment and any feelings of loss, 
mistrust, and anger the patient may experience as therapy ends.

a. Once a month, during treatment, you will be contacted by study staff for a brief phone call 
regarding your participation in the study. These phone calls will take approximately 5 minutes.. 
2. Termination: Upon completion of the treatment, a 3-hour Termination Assessment will be completed. 
During this time, you will be given several additional questionnaires and interviews. 
3. 3-Month Follow-Up: Approximately 3 months after your completion of the treatment, you will be asked 
to complete a follow-up assessment, which will consist of supplementary questionnaires and interviews. 
This visit will be done in person with study staff. 
Expectations and responsibilities of the participants in TFPP are as follows: 
• Keep your study appointments. If it is necessary to miss an appointment, please contact your therapist 
to reschedule as soon as you know you will miss the appointment. 
• Complete your questionnaires as instructed. 
• Ask questions as you think of them. 
• Tell the investigator or research staff if you change your mind about staying in the study. 
• If you are taking any psychiatric medication, we ask that you continue on your current medication 
regimen and keep doses constant for 2 months prior to enrolling in therapy, and throughout the duration 
of this treatment (including the 3-month follow-up period). If you are considering changing anything 
about your medication (type, dose, etc), we ask that you please discuss this with your therapist or study 
staff. 
• While participating in this research study, do not take part in any other research project without 
approval from the investigators; please inform study staff of all in current or future research 
involvement. Taking part in other research studies without approval from the investigators may 
invalidate the results of this research, as well as that of other studies. 
• While participating in this research study, we ask that you not participate in any additional 
psychotherapy programs without approval from investigators. Taking part in other therapies may 
invalidate the results of this research. 
• Do not disclose to research staff which treatment you have been assigned to. 
For those enrolled in the CONTROL group, this is what will happen: 
1. Treatment as Usual (TAU) involves referral to either the PTSD Clinic or to the Outpatient Mental Health 
Clinic where clinic staff will conduct an evaluation of the patient and a treatment plan developed which 
may include group therapy, a variety of types of individual therapy (e.g. CBT which emphasizes 
identifying maladaptive thoughts and behaviors and provides strategies to more effectively meet one's 
goals or supportive therapy which provides a place for patients to articulate their feelings and reflect on

• Distress: There are some risks associated with psychotherapy. Uncommonly, in the short term, 
symptoms may be exacerbated temporarily as conflicted emotional issues arise in treatment or as you 
discuss or confront feared situations. All study therapists are experience with these problems and their 
management. If levels of distress worsen substantially, you will be referred for an evaluation by the 
Mental Health Clinic, and additional referrals may be made depending on your specific case and 
presenting symptoms. 
• Strain from time limitations: There is potential for strain associated with the initial 4-hour assessments, 
termination assessment and follow assessment, as well as commitment to completing a 16-24-week 
treatment series may present time management issues. We will do our best to accommodate your 
schedule. 
Risks of the usual care you receive are not risks of the research and are not included in this consent form. You 
should talk with your health care providers about risks of usual care.
