\textbf{Chapter 3: Systems in Decay (v2)}

We are living through a slow-motion collapse. This isn't hyperbole. It's
the inevitable result of a system that has been disassembling itself
from the inside. Institutions that once ensured stability now serve as
amplifiers of division. Feedback loops, once designed to maintain
equilibrium, have been hijacked by actors who profit from disorder. In
this chapter, I will show how the structures of governance, civic trust,
and public discourse have degraded into vectors of instability---and why
this isn't a bug in the system, but its new operating logic.

\subsubsection{The Fracturing of Institutional
Integrity}\label{the-fracturing-of-institutional-integrity}

The United States once relied on institutions to create a stabilizing
center. Congress, the judiciary, and federal agencies were imperfect,
but they provided checks against authoritarian impulse. Today, these
same institutions are hollowed out---vulnerable to bad faith actors who
exploit their procedures for personal gain (Levitsky \& Ziblatt, 2018).
Congressional hearings have become partisan theater. The Supreme Court,
now firmly aligned with a political agenda, upholds decisions that
contradict public opinion and legal precedent (Chotiner, 2025).

Whistleblowers are criminalized. Inspectors general are fired or
ignored. Agency leadership is packed with loyalists rather than experts.
What remains is institutional theater: the appearance of process masking
the collapse of substance.

\subsubsection{Cognitive Capture and Epistemic
Decay}\label{cognitive-capture-and-epistemic-decay}

One of the most insidious forms of system decay is cognitive capture:
the process by which a population's shared understanding of truth is
eroded. We now live in fractured information ecosystems. The media
landscape has splintered into polarized spheres, where algorithmic feeds
serve confirmation bias rather than challenge it (Haidt \&
Rose-Stockwell, 2021).

Disinformation thrives in such an environment. The same system that once
produced informed citizens now rewards outrage, virality, and simplistic
narratives. As a result, we've replaced nuanced debate with moral panic,
evidence with vibes. Political actors like Donald Trump have capitalized
on this collapse, feeding conspiracies and lies into the public sphere
with impunity (Snyder, 2017).

This isn't a passive failure. It's an engineered condition. Cognitive
capture is a strategy: disorient the public, erode consensus, and make
truth a partisan commodity.

\subsubsection{Surveillance Capitalism and Democratic
Degradation}\label{surveillance-capitalism-and-democratic-degradation}

The commodification of behavior and belief has enabled a new form of
extraction. Surveillance capitalism, as Zuboff (2019) describes it, is
not just a business model. It's a form of control. When every click,
share, or scroll becomes a data point, platforms can nudge entire
populations toward apathy or extremism.

This level of manipulation erodes civic agency. It disables the capacity
for critical reflection. And it collapses the boundary between public
interest and private profit. In such a system, voters become data sets.
Citizens become users. Democracy becomes an illusion.

\subsubsection{Feedback Loops in Crisis}\label{feedback-loops-in-crisis}

System science tells us that feedback loops can be stabilizing or
destabilizing. Positive feedback loops amplify change; negative loops
resist it. What we see today is the predominance of runaway positive
loops: outrage amplifies more outrage, polarization intensifies, and
misinformation spreads faster than correction (Page, 2011).

The system is no longer self-correcting. In fact, its internal signals
have been distorted beyond recognition. The feedback loops we now
inhabit are tuned for acceleration---toward extremism, inequality, and
fragmentation.

\subsubsection{Judicial Capture and Legal
Incoherence}\label{judicial-capture-and-legal-incoherence}

The judiciary---once the last firewall against authoritarian
overreach---has become an accelerant. Recent rulings not only contradict
democratic norms but also dismantle precedent with strategic intent.
Cases like \emph{Dobbs v. Jackson} and the 2025 decision on
third-country deportations illustrate a Court that no longer interprets
law, but engineers ideology (Maine, 2025).

We are watching the institutionalization of cruelty. Legal mechanisms
are being wielded not to protect rights, but to redraw the boundaries of
who qualifies as a rights-bearing subject.

This isn't law. It's legal theater in service of regime goals.

\subsubsection{Disintegration of Civic
Trust}\label{disintegration-of-civic-trust}

When systems decay, people disengage. Civic participation plummets.
Belief in democratic institutions collapses. But what emerges is not
apathy---it's cynicism weaponized by authoritarians.

Populists like Trump understand this dynamic well. They don't need to
win trust. They only need to convince you that \emph{no one} is
trustworthy. When the system appears broken beyond repair,
authoritarianism begins to look like order. And that illusion is enough
to tip the scales.

\subsubsection{The System is Working as Designed---But for
Whom?}\label{the-system-is-working-as-designedbut-for-whom}

Many ask: why aren't the safeguards working? The answer is
uncomfortable: they \emph{are} working---just not for democracy. They
have been retooled to protect power, not distribute it. What we are
seeing isn't a failure of the system, but its success in serving new
masters.

Systems don't collapse evenly. They decay at the margins first: for the
poor, the racialized, the undocumented. But eventually, the rot reaches
the core. What was once invisible becomes unavoidable.

The task now is twofold: to understand this decay not as episodic, but
as systemic; and to begin building feedback systems that reward truth,
distribute power, and resist authoritarian logic.

This is no longer reform. It is reconstruction.
