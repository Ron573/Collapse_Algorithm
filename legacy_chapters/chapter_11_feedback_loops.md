\chapter{Feedback Loops and the Mechanics of Collapse}

At the heart of systemic collapse lies a network of feedback loops—interlocking mechanisms that reinforce dysfunction, suppress reform, and accelerate entropy across institutions. These are not random breakdowns. They are the predictable results of recursive cycles where signals from failed systems are misinterpreted as mandates to double down. In a functioning democracy, negative feedback loops correct course. But in the post-truth regime engineered by Trump and his enablers, positive feedback loops dominate, pushing institutions toward greater instability (Anderson, 2020).

Consider the media ecosystem. Ratings incentivize outrage. Outrage inflames tribal identity. Tribal identity drives algorithmic amplification. Amplification elevates disinformation. Disinformation erodes trust. And the erosion of trust deepens the demand for outrage-driven narratives (Wardle & Derakhshan, 2017). Each cycle strengthens the next. Fox News, for example, became both a signal generator and a feedback amplifier, echoing the administration’s lies while lauding itself as a persecuted truth-teller. Social media platforms became complicit in this architecture, reinforcing the illusion of consensus within ideological silos.

Political institutions were equally compromised. Congressional checks were nullified by partisan loyalty. The judiciary’s independence eroded as Trump appointees strategically reshaped legal interpretation. Executive overreach was normalized under the guise of national security. The feedback was clear: the more Trump violated norms, the more his base rewarded him. Each assault on oversight mechanisms made future oversight less feasible (Levitsky & Ziblatt, 2018).

These loops were not accidental. They were engineered. Cambridge Analytica's psychographic modeling, Facebook's engagement-driven content surfacing, and the algorithmic curation of outrage optimized emotional arousal and reduced cognitive friction—all for profit, and ultimately, for power (Cadwalladr, 2019).

In systems science terms, what we observed was a reduction in system diversity and a simultaneous increase in coupling between domains: media, politics, law, and culture. As resilience theorist C.S. Holling described, such tightly coupled systems become brittle. They lose adaptive capacity. One shock can trigger cascading failures (Holling, 2001).

COVID-19 was that shock. Rather than prompting recalibration, it exposed the depth of capture. The Trump administration undermined the CDC, politicized masks and vaccines, and fed disinformation into the public health system. Death became a partisan statistic. In a functioning feedback system, public health data would drive corrective policy. In Trump’s America, death rates became just another vector for blame, division, and denial (Gollust et al., 2020).

This chapter maps the anatomy of those feedback loops and introduces the concept of \textbf{entropic governance}: a mode of rule that thrives on disorder, leverages disinformation, and systematically disables corrective mechanisms. Trump did not invent these loops. But he exploited them with precision, accelerating the collapse trajectory.

\noindent\textit{Explanation:} The diagram illustrates the recursive cycle in which disinformation, partisan loyalty, algorithmic amplification, and institutional fragility reinforce one another. The loop accelerates entropy, disables systemic correction, and rewards norm violation.
