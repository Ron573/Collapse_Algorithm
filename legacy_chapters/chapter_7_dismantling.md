\chapter{Strategic Dismantling: How Institutions Were Hollowed From Within}

\textit{"The surest way to destroy a system is not to attack it head-on, but to convince it to rot itself from the inside."}

Trump’s second term was not a continuation — it was an acceleration. What began as a bombastic reshaping of federal institutions in his first term became, by 2025, a targeted dismantling campaign. This chapter outlines how institutions of governance, oversight, and accountability were not merely sidelined — they were turned inward and weaponized.

Project 2025 codified what had previously been instinctual. Agencies were stripped of nonpartisan leadership and staffed with loyalists who viewed their mandate not as service but sabotage. The Office of Personnel Management, the Environmental Protection Agency, and even the Congressional Budget Office were transformed into compliance arms of the executive branch.

This phenomenon was not unique to Trump, but it was uniquely efficient under him. As I detailed in \textit{Saboteurs Within: The Strategic Erosion of the Federal Service} (Botelho, 2024), the transformation of public servants into ideological enforcers marked the most efficient authoritarian restructuring of the modern era.

The Federal Election Commission became functionally inert. Inspectors general were fired or silenced. The Government Accountability Office, once a bastion of transparency, was reduced to producing ceremonial reports that no longer influenced oversight.

Trump’s key insight was that bureaucratic complexity provides cover for institutional cannibalism. The dismantling was not overt. It was procedural. Policies were revised through obscure rulemaking processes. Departmental priorities were "realigned." Performance metrics were redefined to reward inaction or ideological purity over service.

The judicial system was also compromised. Not just by packed courts, but by the chilling effect imposed on legal advocates and civil rights defenders. Litigants began to self-censor. Legal aid organizations faced budgetary extinction. The result: a justice system that maintained form but not function.

From a systems science perspective, this represents a terminal phase shift: when a structure preserves its outer shell while its internal mechanisms collapse. This phenomenon is referred to as \textbf{systemic mimicry} — the ability of a corrupted system to maintain legitimacy by imitating its former self.

I wrote in \textit{The Theater of Law: Why Justice Fled the Stage} (Botelho, 2025) that by the time activists and watchdogs recognized the depth of the decay, it was too late. The formal architecture remained, but the organs had been hollowed out. Accountability became symbolic. The system didn’t crash — it ossified.

This chapter is not just a postmortem. It is a systems warning: when dismantling occurs procedurally rather than violently, it becomes harder to detect — and harder to resist.
