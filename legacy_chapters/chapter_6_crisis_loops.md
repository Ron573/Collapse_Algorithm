\chapter{Crisis Loops and the Erosion of Civic Immunity}

\textit{When every day is a five-alarm fire, the public forgets what normal governance looks like.}

This chapter investigates the breakdown of civic immunity under sustained assault — not just from disinformation, but from governance-by-crisis. The Trump administration's methodical disruption of institutions reveals a playbook for overwhelming the system until it buckles.

Where Chapter 5 explored the normalization of emergencies, this chapter examines how those emergencies become self-perpetuating feedback loops. Borrowing from systems theory, we identify the pattern as a cybernetic loop: crisis triggers outrage; outrage disables deliberation; disabled deliberation paves the way for executive overreach.

Trump’s use of spectacle — border wall theatrics, pandemic press conferences, or disinformation-laden tweets — was not noise, but signal. Each moment of chaos created cover for deeper structural rewiring. The administrative state was not merely ignored; it was converted into a weapon against itself. Agencies were hollowed out, redirected, or discredited — weakening their capacity and public trust simultaneously.

This tactic, referred to by Berman (2024) as the “controlled demolition of the administrative state,” created what systems thinkers call a “punctuated equilibrium.” Periods of calm were shattered by sudden shocks, making adaptation impossible and forcing perpetual reaction.

A striking case of this was the CDC's suppression during COVID-19. Vital public health guidance was subverted, edited, or replaced by political talking points. The U.S. response was not just flawed; it was sabotaged. In this case, civic immunity—the system's ability to reject falsehood and coordinate truth—was deliberately attacked.

In my earlier article, \textit{Feedback Authoritarianism: How Trump Rewired Response Systems} (Botelho, 2024), I argued that each crisis wasn't an aberration but a test. The public's threshold for shock, disbelief, and eventual resignation was constantly recalibrated. The danger was not the crisis itself, but the learned helplessness it produced.

The erosion of civic immunity is not easily reversed. Institutions depend on time, credibility, and public belief to function. Once these are undermined, they become slow to respond even when reclaimed. In systems language, resilience is replaced by brittleness.

The MAGA era is not just a political moment. It is a systems breakdown event. It is not just what Trump did, but what he taught the system to accept.
