\section{Chapter 6: Crisis Loops and the Logic of Self-Destruction}\label{chapter-6-crisis-loops-and-the-logic-of-self-destruction}

\subsection{The System Eats Itself}\label{the-system-eats-itself}

No complex system collapses all at once---it feeds on its own feedback until it implodes. Crisis becomes the new equilibrium. In America, we are witnessing crisis loops---self-perpetuating feedback cycles that no longer aim to solve problems but to exploit them for profit and power. If democracy were a living organism, it would now be devouring its own tissue in search of calories.

Consider the political economy of disaster: when calamity strikes, whether it's a pandemic, mass shooting, climate event, or insurrection, certain actors profit. Corporations sell ``solutions,'' politicians fundraise off fear, and the media monetizes outrage (Zuboff, 2019). The system has no incentive to break the loop because the loop is lucrative. In systems terms, this is positive feedback run amok---growth not toward equilibrium, but toward instability.

The more we spin inside these crisis loops, the harder it becomes to intervene. Each new shock is absorbed by a system trained to weaponize dysfunction. Institutional legitimacy erodes, while a kind of disaster fatigue sets in among the public. As a result, accountability dies.

\subsection{The Political Utility of Collapse}\label{the-political-utility-of-collapse}

Collapse, far from being avoided, becomes politically useful. In 2025, political operatives openly discussed the benefits of destabilization: reduced regulatory barriers, easier judicial manipulation, and a population too distracted or frightened to resist (Chotiner, 2025). When the system rewards sabotage, sabotage becomes the system.

A powerful example lies in the judicial system. The Supreme Court's alignment with MAGA priorities is no longer hidden. As Ms.~Maine (2025) observes, it increasingly serves not as a neutral arbiter, but as a mechanism of exclusion and cruelty. Its rulings now reflect a deliberate entrenchment of minority rule.

The structural fragility that results is systemic, not accidental. And it radiates outward: through economic inequality, information warfare, and climate breakdown. Each crisis begets another, and each is metabolized into political opportunity by those who engineer the system.

\subsection{Thermodynamic Collapse: The Cost of Erasing Truth}\label{thermodynamic-collapse-the-cost-of-erasing-truth}

Landauer's Principle tells us that erasing one bit of information costs energy (Bérut et al., 2012). That may seem trivial---until you apply it at scale. What happens when entire segments of reality are erased? When governments wipe data, when platforms censor history, when regimes rewrite memory? The energy cost isn't just computational---it's social and cognitive. Whole institutions are destabilized.

In the context of American disinformation, every deletion of truth---about history, science, or democracy---creates an energetic burden. The public must work harder to recover what was lost, if they ever can. The result: exhaustion, confusion, apathy. Collapse.

The concept extends beyond physics: it enters the realm of epistemology and civic integrity. Systems that erase history must expend massive effort to maintain that erasure. Eventually, they fail. The more they erase, the more energy they need, until they collapse under their own informational contradictions.

\subsection{A Layperson's Framework}\label{a-laypersons-framework}

Imagine a house where every memory, every truth, every lesson must be consciously preserved or it vanishes. Now imagine that house has no books, no records, no pictures. The residents must keep everything in their heads. As time passes, they forget---then repeat their mistakes. This is America under engineered crisis loops: memory-holed, exhausted, and reactive.

Landauer's Principle reminds us that memory has a cost. And losing memory has a greater one. Every time a system erases truth, history, or memory, it pays for it in energy and complexity---and ultimately collapses.
