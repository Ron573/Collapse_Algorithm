To those who resist—

This book is for the analysts, the organizers, the teachers, the whistleblowers, and the ordinary citizens who refuse to be complicit. For those who still ask hard questions, who still believe in shared truth, and who choose the harder right over the easier wrong.

To my professors, classmates, and colleagues in systems science—you sharpened the lens through which I see the world. Thank you for your time, feedback, and trust.

And to the people I served with: your courage lives in every word of this resistance document.
