## 🧠 What Is *Collapse Algorithm*?

**Collapse Algorithm** is a multidisciplinary, systems-level critique of how authoritarian power consolidates through engineered disinformation, digital surveillance, and judicial permissiveness. Combining insights from over **50+ Substack articles**, thermodynamic entropy, and information theory, this book exposes the infrastructural and psychological pipelines that drive collective compliance and political decay.

This is not just a book. It is **a resistance node in code, theory, and narrative**.

## 🔍 Core Questions Explored

- What is the thermodynamic cost of **erasing memory**—historically, digitally, and legally?
- How do entropy, feedback loops, and Markov transitions help us model **systemic collapse**?
- What role do figures like Donald Trump, J.D. Vance, and Elon Musk play in the **engineered consent pipeline**?
- How has the judicial system become a **compliance mechanism**, rather than a safeguard?
