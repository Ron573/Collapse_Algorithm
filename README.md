## 🧠 What Is *Collapse Algorithm*?

**Collapse Algorithm** is a multidisciplinary, systems-level critique of how authoritarian power consolidates through engineered disinformation, digital surveillance, and judicial permissiveness. Combining insights from over **50+ Substack articles**, thermodynamic entropy, and information theory, this book exposes the infrastructural and psychological pipelines that drive collective compliance and political decay.

This is not just a book. It is **a resistance node in code, theory, and narrative**.

---

## 🔍 Core Questions Explored

- What is the thermodynamic cost of **erasing memory**—historically, digitally, and legally?
- How do entropy, feedback loops, and Markov transitions help us model **systemic collapse**?
- What role do figures like Donald Trump, J.D. Vance, and Elon Musk play in the **engineered consent pipeline**?
- How has the judicial system become a **compliance mechanism**, rather than a safeguard?

---

## 🧩 Technical Architecture

- 📄 Written in LaTeX (`Collapse_Algorithm_final_main.tex`)
- 📚 APA 7th citations via `biblatex` + `biber`
- 📊 All figures are embedded as PNGs under `Images/`
- 🔬 Chapters combine Markdown + TeX workflows (`chapters/`)
- 🧠 Appendices include terminology, datasets, and code

---

## 🧪 Compile Instructions (macOS / TeXShop)

To compile the full book:

```bash
./build_book.sh
```

This will produce a fully-rendered `Collapse_Algorithm_final_main.pdf` with all chapters, figures, and appendices.
