Every time a system erases truth, history, or memory, it pays for it—in energy, in complexity, and ultimately in collapse.

This thermodynamic principle of informational erasure, known as Landauer's Limit, is not only a law of physics, but a warning. It tells us that truth suppression is never free. Every erased fact, every rewritten narrative, and every forbidden memory imposes a cost.

When these costs accumulate—in our politics, our institutions, and our collective psyche—they produce heat, noise, and disintegration. Collapse, in this light, is not a sudden event. It is the logical outcome of a thousand small deletions.

This book is about those deletions.
